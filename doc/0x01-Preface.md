## About TVD-CriticalPatchReport {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The Oracle Critical Patch Advisory is released every three months and addresses
major security issues in Oracle databases, application servers and other Oracle
products. In many cases, it is difficult to determine whether a critical patch
needs to be applied immediately in a production environment or not. This is
where the Accenture Critical Patch Report comes in. Accenture tests several
critical patches on different Oracle products and versions. The test results are
summarized in the TVD-CriticalPatchReport and released in the same cycle. The
report helps in deciding whether a Critical Patch Update needs to be installed
or not and provides valuable tips.

Your benefits

- Recommendations: When to install the patch and when not to.
- Tips to keep in mind when installing the CPU.
- Information about whether the database will behave differently after the CPU
  has been installed.

The TVD-CriticalPatchReport is distributed to Accenture customers as part of the
Managed Service Agreement or can alternatively be purchased as a separate service.
